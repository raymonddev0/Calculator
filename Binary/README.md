# Binary Calculator

Adapted from HackerRank 10 Days of Javascript - Day 9: Binary Calculator

### Objective

In this challenge, we implement a calculator that uses binary numbers.

### Task

Implement a simple calculator that performs the following operations on binary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Note that division operation must be integer division only; for example, `1001/100=10`, `1110/101=10`, and `101/1=101`.

### Constraints

- All expressions in the test dataset are entered in the form `operand1 -> operator -> operand2`, where `operand1` is the first binary number, `operand2` is the second binary number, and `operator` is in the set `{+,-,*,/}`.
- Both operands will always be positive integers when converted from base-2 to base-10.
